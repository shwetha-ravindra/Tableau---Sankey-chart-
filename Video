Let's delve into the insights gleaned from our Sankey chart:

𝟏) 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: The Sankey chart visually maps the flow of sales across different regions and segments. This allows us to discern which segments excel in each region and spot any emerging regional trends.

𝟐) 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧: By gauging the thickness of the flow lines, we can compare the relative sales performance of different segments within each region. This aids in pinpointing dominant segments and areas for improvement.

𝟑) 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬: Variances in the width of flows between regions reveal potential disparities in sales distribution. This prompts deeper exploration into factors influencing sales across diverse regions.

𝟒) 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬-𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬: Keep an eye out for consistent segment performance across multiple regions or notable deviations. These patterns unveil segments with broader appeal or region-specific preferences.

𝟓) 𝐎𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Discrepancies in segment sales between regions unveil opportunities for targeted marketing or product adaptation to cater to specific regional needs.

𝟔) 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐅𝐥𝐨𝐰: The comprehensive view of sales flow between regions and segments offers a bird's-eye perspective of sales distribution across our dataset. This aids in spotting significant trends or anomalies.
